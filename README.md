## Overview ##
This repository contains my first two projects made on Unity. The projects were made in spring of 2024.

## Chess 3d
This project was made to challenge my problem skills to implement the chess rules in c#. It contains a scene where two players on the same computer can play chess with each other.

## Aimlabs
a scene where players can practice their aim, with extensive customization over the target behavior
